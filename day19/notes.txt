PART 1

Unknown rotation and facing direction
x, y, z

For each beacon coord in scanner x:
    for each 24 orientations of each beacon coord in scanner y:
        Assume the coords point at the same beacon,
        orientate all other beacon coords in y from scanner x
        iterate through x and orientated y, count and store overlapping points
        after current iteration check
        if > 12 common beacons:
            stop here because that's what the challenge
            indicates is a match for reconstruction

Do this between x and all scanners

Meanwhile for each scanner a that has > 12 common beacons with x
storing those beacon coords/adding to a full set (reconstruction)

absolute orientation cannot be found with this info, we are just fixing
scanner 0's orientation, finding beacons/scanners (according to condition)
then reconstructing a 3d map relative to that orientation



Rotations of cube while considering each side as the base
6 sides * 4 orientations each = 24 total orientations

Start at x, y, z (i.e. assume the current orientation of the scanner
being evaluated is identical to that of scanner 0)
