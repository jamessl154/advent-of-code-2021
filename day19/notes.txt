PART 1

Unknown rotation and facing direction
x, y, z

https://www.geogebra.org/3d?lang=en


For each beacon coord in scanner x:
    for each 24 orientations of each beacon coord in scanner y:
        Assume the coords point at the same beacon,
        orientate all other beacon coords in y from scanner x
        iterate through x and orientated y, count and store overlapping points
        after current iteration check
        if > 12 common beacons:
            stop here because that's what the challenge
            indicates is a match for reconstruction

Do this between x and all scanners

Meanwhile for each scanner a that has > 12 common beacons with x
storing those beacon coords/adding to a full set (reconstruction)

absolute orientation cannot be found with this info, we are just fixing
scanner 0's orientation, finding beacons/scanners (according to condition)
then reconstructing a 3d map relative to that orientation


Rotations of cube while considering each side as the base
6 sides * 4 orientations each = 24 total orientations

Start at x, y, z (i.e. assume the current orientation of the scanner
being evaluated is identical to that of scanner 0)

iterate through scanner_0, how many matches do we have in the current orientation
if scanner[0] and scanner_0[0] point to the same point

then 2nd orientation, scanner[0] + scanner_0[0] point to same point?
then 3nd orientation, scanner[0] + scanner_0[0] point to same point?
...

finally 24th orientation,

now scanner[1] and scanner_0[0]

...

finally scanner[len(scanner) - 1] and scanner_0[0]

...

repeat all with scanner_0[1] ... e.t.c

-----------------

Big error interpreting the challenge => to add a scanner to the map we must find
12 overlapping beacons between this scanner and any scanner that already exists in
the map.

E.g. Proven scanner[0] and scanner[1] share 12 common points

scanner[0] and scanner[1] exist in the map

condition for scanners[2] joining the map is sharing 12 common points with either
scanner[0] or scanner[1] ... e.t.c.

Need to rerun the process until all beacons are mapped
