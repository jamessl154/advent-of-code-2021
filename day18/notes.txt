addition(a, b):
    sum = [a,b]
    reduce(sum)

reduce(): 
    Priority list, restart list on match
        1. first pair nested in four pairs explodes
        2. first num >= 10 splits

    explode(pair):
        a <- [3,2] -> b
        a and b stay in place
        pair explodes and becomes 0
        a, pair and b become: a + 3, 0, b + 2
        if number a or b don't exist, no action on that side

    split(num):
        from math import floor, ceil

        num becomes [math.floor(num/2),math.ceil(num/2)]
        
        10 => [5,5]
